<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>Data –</b></div><div><div>Citibike data includes information of  users’ birth year, start and end station, date, time, etc. We use Jan 2015 data. Then we split the data into two groups, e.g. Young: age same or under 30, Old: age over 30. We dropped the data which doesn’t contain age information. Trip distance is calculated by using Pythagorean theorem as we know only start and end station latitude and longitude instead of distance.</div><div></div><div>As the result of calculation, the average trip distance for Over30 is 0.01488 and Under30 is 0.01439. </div><div></div></div>
