<div>Intuitively, we can assume that young people have more stamina and are more active than older people. In this experiment, we examine whether this assumption is true, using Citibike data, comparing the average trip distance of young and old riders. </div><div>Carrying out t-test, we found out the difference is significant. However, we also found out that the older group has longer average trip distance than that of younger, which is not intuitive. This implies that older group has significantly longer average trip distance than that of younger. </div><div>As this is not intuitive, we tried same test using different dataset. As a result, we did not see the significant difference between two sample means.</div><div>I didn’t change the initial Alternative hypothesis (the younger, the more active) to be hypothesis driven. </div><div><b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>Introduction -</b></div><div>Generally speaking, young people are more active than the old. However, the older are becoming more and more active than ever because of rising health consciousness and high-quality healthcare system. In order to give useful implication for these discussions, we will examine whether young Citibike riders have longer average trip distance than that of older riders.</div><div>Citibike is docked-sharing bike dotted around NYC and the usage data is open to the public. Based on the calculated ages of the riders, we set </div><div>Null hypothesis – H0: Older riders (age 31~) have same or longer average trip distance than that of younger riders (age 0 ~ 30).</div><div>Alternative hypothesis – H1: Younger riders have longer average trip distance than that of older riders.</div><div><b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>Data –</b></div><div>Citibike data includes information of users’ birth year, start and end station, date, time, etc. We use Jan 2015 data. Then we split the data into two groups, e.g. Young: age same or under 30, Old: age over 30. We dropped the data which doesn’t contain age information. Trip distance is calculated by using Pythagorean theorem as we know only start and end station latitude and longitude instead of distance.</div><div>As the result of calculation, the average trip distance for Over30 is 0.01488 and Under30 is 0.01439. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b>Figure 1: Figure 1 shows average trip distance by age group. The average for Over30 is 0.01488 and Under30 is 0.01439, meaning the difference is too small to see in this graph.</b></div><div><b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>Methodology -</b></div><div>We compare the average trip distance between two groups and to do so, we use t-test for independent samples. The motivation behind this choice is:</div><div>- We compare the means of two samples. </div><div>- We can use a parametric test as the population is large enough.</div><div>- The samples are independent.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>&nbsp;Result of t-test</b></div><div>The result is shown below. We can say the difference is significant. </div><div>t-value=9.132</div><div>P-value=6.725145754446088e-20</div><div>However, now we need to re-think our H1 hypothesis 'younger people move longer distance', which is not true in terms of the average trip distance in our sample. On the contrary, Average Distance: Old = 0.01488, Young = 0.01439. Therefore, this result of t-test implies that older group has significantly longer average trip distance than that of the younger group. However, we should not change the hypotheses after starting analysis as we should be hypothesis-driven.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Conclusions -</b></div><div>We got the result above which is not intuitive. Therefore, we examined with different data set to check robustness. Using Citibike data of June 2015, we carried out the same experiment. Again, the average trip distance in the older group is longer than that of younger, and we got p-value of 0.59, which is not significant. </div><div>While we assumed that the younger ride longer distance, the result was opposite, which makes this research complicated. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Acknowledgments</b></div><div>My referee gave me several insightful advise and I am happy to follow his advises as I agree with his opinions.</div><div>He recommended me to do t-test. I agree with that because we compare the means of two samples and can use a parametric test as the population is large enough.</div><div>Also, he recommended me to add a figure which compares two means directly. As this may clarify the difference of two sample means, I added the figure 1. </div><div>While he recommended me to slightly change the way to express H0 and H1 equations, I think either of my expression and his expression is fine. </div>
